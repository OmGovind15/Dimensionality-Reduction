## Project Overview
The project aims to explore and compare two dimensionality reduction techniques:  
1. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**  
2. **Sparse Principal Component Analysis (Sparse PCA)**  

By leveraging these techniques, we reduce the dimensions of high-dimensional datasets while retaining essential features, and visualize the results to highlight the differences in how these methods transform the data.

## Features
- Implementation of PCA using standard libraries for dimensionality reduction.  
- Application of Sparse PCA to enforce sparsity constraints in principal components.  
- Visualization of the transformed data and their respective components to compare the effectiveness of PCA and Sparse PCA.
